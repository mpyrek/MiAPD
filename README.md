# Choosing the best skiing hotel with the AHP/EVM method üèÇüèº

This is a simple desktop python application for the Decision Algorithms 2022/23 course project. 

### Short description

The application uses the AHP/EVM method to compare skiing hotels. It allows the user to select their preferences based on few particular features, compares the possible options and finds the most suitable one.

The user can compare the hotels in terms of:
- price (¬£)
- distance from lift (m)
- altitude (m)
- total piste distance (km)
- total lifts
- total gondolas

### Installation & requirements
To run the program the user should:

- have a Python version: 3.10+ installed
- install all the packages listed in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/mpyrek/MiAPD/blob/main/requirements.txt) file by running the following command in the terminal
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
- run the following command
    
    `python main.py`

### Libraries used:
- numPy
- tkinter
- pandas
- csv
- Azure theme for ttk

### Usage
Firstly, the user chooses the criterion which they consider the most important and its target range. Secondly, the application 
selects 3 most favorable options. Then, the user clicks "Get the Expert's view" and the expert (potentially the user) compares the 3 above-mentioned options - hotels in terms of every criterion using Saaty's 1-9 scale. After that, the user clicks "Get weights" and similarly the expert compares all the criteria with each other. Finally, we can calculate the result after clicking "Calculate".
